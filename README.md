  # CCTV 관리자 대시보드

  This is a code bundle for CCTV 관리자 대시보드. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/FXYF8x29t0JGy3BWTlUhVl/CCTV-%EA%B4%80%EB%A6%AC%EC%9E%90-%EB%8C%80%EC%8B%9C%EB%B3%B4%EB%93%9C.

  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

  ## AI alert routing

  Active AI danger alerts are routed only to the personal/user and company/business monitoring dashboard. The admin dashboard does not subscribe to the AI SSE event stream and does not play alarm sounds.

  When a danger event is unacknowledged, the monitoring dashboard repeats an alarm every 2 seconds. Clicking an alert card or Confirm focuses the related camera, and Confirm marks that event as acknowledged so the alarm stops once all current danger alerts are confirmed.
